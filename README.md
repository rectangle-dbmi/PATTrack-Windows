# PATTrack-Windows
Universal Windows Platform version of PAT Realtime Tracker

This will eventually be the UWP version of the app.  There isn't much here yet.

To build:
 - clone the repository
 - open PATTrack.sln in Visual Studio 2015
 - add a file called Strings/Resources.resw in the project and add the Bing Maps and Port Authority API keys, with keys of mc.MapServiceToken and PAT_KEY respectively
